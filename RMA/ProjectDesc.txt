For the Coding Dojo project, I will focus on developing the first stage, which includes login and registration, as well as full CRUD functionality for technicians, users, clients, and support tickets. This will provide a solid foundation, and later, I can continue expanding the project in the future at the office.

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to let me know.
